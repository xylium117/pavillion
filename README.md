## Overview 🌟

Pavillion allows you to simulate exciting cricket matches using both custom and historical teams. Whether you're a cricket enthusiast looking to relive classic International Test matches or a fan eager to create your own teams, Pavillion has something for you.

## Features 📂

Here are some of the exciting projects you'll find in this gallery:

1. **Custom Team** 
   - *Description:* Create your own teams by selecting players from a roster of cricketers between 1877 to 2020, customizing stats, and defining new lineups.
  
2. **National Teams** 
   - *Description:* Choose from a variety of natinoal teams and legendary players to recreate iconic matches. If you're feeling lazy, specify an era, and the computer will create the best possible team for that nation with players from that era.

3. **Test Match Simulation** 
   - *Description:* Simulate matches with "real"-time updates and get realistic scores in a sleek format. A player's ability varies indefinitely with each simulation and is scaled to fit into the comparison of the modern era. All players begin with average stats compiled from their playing career.

4. **Detailed Match Reports** 
   - *Description:* Receive comprehensive match summaries, including player performances, scores, and key events.

5. **Configurable Rules**
   - *Description:* Adjust in-game settings, weather, field and pitch conditions, as well as player stats and data.
